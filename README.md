# DB Object Dropping With a SQL Server Schedular
Some time we need setup a demo environment to our client server for a specific time/period/days. Suppose after your trial period you may not have access to client server or you may forgot delete your setup environment. That's why I've made one/two SP &amp; a SQL Job Scheduler to delete the demo SQL environment/DB objects automatically from your client server/machine.
